# CalcPilot

*English | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)*

A grounded GenAI learning prototype for **Calculus 1**. Its focused learning
path has three stages:

1. **Concept:** retrieve an attributed MIT Calculus section and build a cited card.
2. **Practice:** serve verified textbook exercises or generate one of four question formats.
3. **Tutor:** use a Chroma-grounded Socratic agent that asks for reasoning instead
   of revealing the answer.

The system includes input/output guardrails, server-enforced explain-to-unlock,
low-evidence engagement checks, and reproducible evaluation fixtures.

Built with **React + Vite** (frontend), **FastAPI** (backend), **SQLite**
(learning records and question cache), and **Chroma RAG** (textbook retrieval). This is the demo for
the capstone project on *explanation-driven learning in college mathematics*,
designed to be extended into a Learnvia-compatible module later.

## Why this design

The project background emphasizes capturing students' **explanations,
justifications, and revisions**. To make that the centerpiece (and to give the
planned study a clean comparison), the tutor supports two **experimental
conditions**:

| Condition | Behavior | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `explain` | **Explain-to-unlock**: the student must justify their reasoning ("why/how") before the tutor advances to the next hint. | Treatment group |
| `control` | Normal progressive Socratic hints, no forced explanation. | Control group |

Every turn is logged to `data/logs/<session_id>.jsonl` (student text, reasoning
assessment, action taken, latency, mastery), which is the raw data for analysing
explanation-driven learning.

## Setup

Quick setup on macOS/Linux:

```bash
bash setup_calcpilot.sh
bash run_calcpilot.sh
```

Or install and run each service manually:

1. Create a Python environment (Python 3.9+) and install backend dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the React frontend dependencies (Node.js 18+):

```bash
cd frontend-web
npm install
cd ..
```

2. No RAG build step is required. The repository includes a ready-to-use
Chroma snapshot for all eight MIT Calculus chapters plus the runtime textbook
figures. The backend validates this snapshot on startup.

The matching sentence-transformer is packaged at
`data/models/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, so semantic retrieval does not require a model
download. Set `RAG_EMBEDDING_MODEL_DIR` only when replacing it.

3. Configure credentials. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your key:

```
LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.openlux.ai/v1
LLM_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

> Security note: never commit `.env`. If a key was ever pasted in chat or shared,
> rotate it in the provider dashboard.

## Run

Open two terminals from the project root.

**Terminal 1 — backend:**

```bash
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

**Terminal 2 — frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend-web
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5175 and follow **Concept → Practice → Tutor**.
Concept, Practice, and Tutor responses expose the MIT sections used for grounding.
Wrong practice answers remain hidden so the student can retry or request a
guided hint.

### Student vs instructor view

The page is **student-facing** by default: it hides the experiment internals
(condition, reasoning scores, hint levels) and shows a clean experience with an
encouraging progress bar. The experimental condition is assigned **randomly
behind the scenes** and still recorded in the logs.

Use the **Teacher / Student** switch in the sidebar to move between the two
experiences. The teacher view reads the same learning records generated by the
student flow.

## Tests and evaluation

Deterministic tests do not require a live LLM:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
python -m scripts.evaluate_agent
```

Optional live checks, with the backend running:

```bash
python -m scripts.smoke_test       # LLM + agent behavior
python -m scripts.api_test         # full conversation over the API
python -m scripts.test_generation  # generate + grade all four question types
```

## Analytics (for the empirical study)

Every turn is logged to `data/logs/<session_id>.jsonl`. To turn those logs into
comparison tables and charts:

The app automatically creates `data/calculus_tutor.sqlite3`; no separate
database service or installation is required. It stores learning events and the
pre-generated question pool. Student submissions feed the teacher's class-level
topic statistics through the same backend.

```bash
python -m scripts.seed_sessions   # OPTIONAL: generate demo sessions (backend up)
python -m scripts.analyze_logs    # build reports/ tables + figures
```

Outputs land in `reports/`:
- `turns.csv`, `sessions.csv`, `condition_summary.csv`
- `figures/condition_comparison.png` — reasoning quality, explanation length,
  solve rate, final mastery (explain vs control)
- `figures/assessment_distribution.png` — distribution of reasoning quality

Both conditions are *measured* the same way; the only manipulation is whether
the tutor *requires* an explanation before advancing (explain-to-unlock). That
keeps the explain-vs-control comparison fair.

## Scope & roadmap

**Implemented (v0.4):** MIT Calculus Chapters 1–8 in one Chroma collection,
metadata-filtered concept/example retrieval, verified textbook exercises plus
RAG-grounded generation in four formats, cited Socratic tutoring, server-side
grading without wrong-answer leakage, explain-to-unlock, bilingual guardrails,
a persistent pre-generated question pool, adaptive next-step recommendations,
SQLite/JSONL learning events, deterministic tests, and an evaluation script.

**Roadmap (not implemented):** symbolic verification of generated mathematics,
persistent sessions, validated student models (BKT/DKT), multimodal input,
and LTI integration.

## Textbook attribution

Textbook excerpts come from Gilbert Strang's *Calculus*, provided by MIT
OpenCourseWare under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. This project uses the Fall 2017 Chapter
1–8 PDF resources. Indexed chunks retain chapter, section, page, figure, source,
and attribution metadata. The reviewed runtime figures and ready-to-use Chroma
snapshot are committed so a fresh clone does not need to rebuild the RAG data.

## Demo and resume wording

Suggested demo: select **Chain Rule** → inspect a cited concept card → generate
a practice item → show direct-answer blocking → explain a valid step to unlock
the next hint → inspect reasoning, safety, and mastery signals in instructor
view.

Accurate resume summary:

> Built a RAG-grounded Socratic calculus agent using local semantic retrieval
> over eight chapters of MIT Calculus stored in Chroma; implemented server-enforced
> explain-to-unlock, bidirectional anti-leak guardrails, engagement signals,
> and a golden-set evaluation pipeline for retrieval, citation, policy, and
> answer-leak metrics.
